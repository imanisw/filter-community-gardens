      <p class="intro"> <p><b>DECEMBER 17, 2021</b> - New York City is a place where land and space is a finite but valuable resource. With <a href= "http://vacantlandnyc.com/"> nearly 26,000 underutilized or vacant plots of land in the city</a>, Queens residents are finding use for land they believe could be used more effectively to address the needs of their communities.</p>

     <p>Gil Lopez, an urban farmer and environmentalist from Western Queens, is one such person. He is a co-founder of the Smiling Hogshead Ranch in Long Island City, a garden established on top of a decommissioned MTA track. “We started as a guerilla garden,” says Lopez. “They do not ask permission to do the work that they do, they do it covertly.”</p>

     <p>The Smiling Hogshead Ranch is peppered with raised garden beds bearing different species of lettuce, Kale, cilantro and beets. There is a compost station that saw a lot of traffic during the height of the pandemic when the city shut down curbside compost services. “Really, what this project is about for me is providing a place for us to work with the land,” says Lopez. “To actually be out in the sun, amongst the trees and with each other.”</p>

     <p>The ranch functions as a community space as well, hosting workshops about urban gardening and grassroots organizing. Lopez even sees the garden as a communal practice in democracy. “Participating in community groups that are democratically run, can lead to a sharper political understanding,” he says. “And in a city where real estate is one of the most commodified items, gardening is political.”</p>

     <p>Ability to grow and sustain food in an urban environment enables communities to mitigate the effects of food deserts and food insecurity, both large issues across the city and in Queens specifically.</p>

     <p>Affordable housing remains a concern for a large portion of New York City residents as well. This is one issue that Community Land Trusts, or CLTs, hope to combat by buying land on behalf of communities in order to serve their needs.</p>

     <p>The Western Queens Community Land Trust was founded by a group of Queens residents opposing the establishment of an Amazon Headquarters back in 2018, fearing it would rapidly gentrify the area and push out residents. “This was born out of several of us, getting together and thinking ‘how do we safeguard our communities from these huge developers,’” says Memo Salazar, co-chair of the Western Queens Community Land Trust.</p>

     <p>The Land Trust’s current project revolves around converting the Long Island City Department of Education building, which initially was going to be sold to Amazon, into a robust community center. “By turning it into a community hub, all the issues surrounding affordability could be solved with this one space,” says Salazar. “From artists who need studios to immigrant businesses who can’t afford rent anymore.”</p>

     <p>The Land Trust was awarded a $20,000 grant from the New Economy Project this year to test its feasibility and are hoping to move forward with the project.</p>

     <p>New York City has a long and detailed history of community land reclamation. During the 15th Annual NYC Anarchist Bookfair, humanities professor Rebecca Amato spoke at length about urban land reclamation, a phenomenon that is by no means new in the city. “It is an opportunity to redefine what land and property could mean to them.”</p>

     <p>Space will always be a finite resource in large metropolitan cities like New York, but what communities decide to do with them, without or without permission, remains with them.</p>
