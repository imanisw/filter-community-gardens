     <p class="intro"> <p><b>DECEMBER 17, 2021</b> - President Joe Biden announced he would reinstate former President Donald Trump’s Migration Protection Protocols (MPP), or “Remain in Mexico” policy, that requires those seeking asylum in the United States to wait in Mexico.</p>

     <p>Countries like El Salvador and Honduras still saw a substantial number of minors make their way to the border between 2018 and 2019. In 2019 alone, El Salvador saw a 142 percent increase in unaccompanied minors and Honduras, an 86 percent increase.</p>

<p>Factors that cause migration vary from economic, political, social, and even climate instability.</p>

<p>Especially in countries located in the “dry corridor,” a region prone to natural disasters. And as climate catastrophes increase due to climate change, the agricultural populations living there are left vulnerable, according to Isabel Gil-Everaert, a Ph.D. student at The Graduate Center and adjunct professor at the City College of New York.</p>

<p>“Flows change. This is not just economic migration,” said Gil-Everaert, pointing to a particular increase in political and social instability in El Salvador between 2018 and 19. “It is also people fleeing violence and gangs.”</p>

<p>In 2020, the number of unaccompanied children encountered at the border decreased in all countries.
Partially, explained by COVID-19 immigration restrictions, Trump’s MPP policy, and Title 42 policy which allows U.S. Border Patrol to expel migrants immediately, including children, making it less likely for individuals to attempt the journey, says Gil-Everaert.</p>

  <p>The Biden administration recently <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/immigration/biden-administration-exits-talks-over-compensation-families-separated-border-n1286163"> exited negotiations to financially compensate families </a> separated at the border by the U.S.</p>

  <p>And with the Omicron variant spiking globally, a resurgence of restrictive immigration policies might be on the horizon for the Biden administration. </p>
